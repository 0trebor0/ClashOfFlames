                                    1. Download Clash of Clans IPA file available at http://clashofthrones.servegame.com .<br>
                                    2. Cydia impactor available at <a href="http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/" style="text-decoration: underline;color:blue;" target="_blank">http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/</a> .<br>
                                    <span style="color:#000;">(Special Note: This tool, developed by Saurik, is used to sign the ipa file so that Pangu jailbreak tool can be executed on iOS devices. Cydia impactors does not collect your apple id and password. All the information is only used for applying a personal free certificate from Apple.)</span><br>
                                    3. A computer (Cydia impactor runs on all major OSes, including Windows, OS X, and Linux)<br>
                                    4. A valid Apple ID. (In case that you do not want to use your current Apple ID to apply the personal certificate for any reason, we suggest you apply a new Apple ID and use it)<br>

                                <b>To Apple Developers:</b>
                                <div style="padding-left:25px;">If you have enrolled the Apple developer membership, signing the IPA file with your own developer certification is a better choice (i.e., Clash of Thrones app will get expired in 1 year, rather than 7 days).</div>

                                <b>Install Clash of Thrones guide:</b>
                                <p>
                                    1. Unzip the Cydia impactor file and run it.<p>
                                    2. Connect your iOS device to your computer and trust the computer on your iOS device.<p>
                                    3. Drag Clash of Thrones.ipa into Cydia impactor app.<p>

                                    4. Input you email address( it’s your apple id)<p>
                                    <img src="http://en.pangu.io/images/en/help3.png" style="width:100%;max-width:325px;"><p>
                                    5. Input your apple ID password. <p>
                                    <img src="http://en.pangu.io/images/en/help4.png" style="width:100%;max-width:325px;"><p>
                                    6. Click OK button to continue.<p>
                                    <img src="http://en.pangu.io/images/en/help2.png" style="width:100%;max-width:472px;"><p>
                                    7. Cydia impactor will automatically prepare everything based on your inputs and sign the IPA file. If everything is OK, the IPA file should be installed in your iOS device correctly. If you get error notifications, you probably input incorrect Apple ID or password.<br>
                                    8.  On your device, Tap Settings &gt; General &gt; Device Management. You then see a profile for the developer under your “apple ID” heading. Tap the profile to establish trust for this developer. (An Internet connection is required to verify the app developer's certificate when establishing trust.)<br>
                                    9. On your device, find Clash of Thrones App and run it.<p>
                                    10. Play, enjoy and have fun.
